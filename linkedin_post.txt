🧠 Ever wondered what neural networks REALLY compute? Here's something that was not intuitive to me:

Deep learning models with ReLU activations are PIECEWISE LINEAR functions! 🤯

Yes, despite modeling incredibly complex patterns, these networks are just stitching together LINEAR PIECES. Each "piece" corresponds to a different activation pattern - which neurons are ON vs OFF. 😮

🔍 What does this mean?

✅ A network with n neurons can create up to 2^n different linear regions
✅ Within each region, the function is EXACTLY linear (f(x) = Ax + b)
✅ Boundaries between regions are where neurons switch states
✅ More regions = more expressive power

🎯 Why should you care?

This fundamental property explains:
→ How neural networks achieve UNIVERSAL APPROXIMATION
→ Why ADVERSARIAL EXAMPLES exist (they exploit region boundaries)
→ How MODEL PRUNING works (merge similar regions)
→ Why LINEAR MODE CONNECTIVITY happens between trained models

I asked #ClaudeCode to create an INTERACTIVE DEMO with visualizations, Jupyter notebooks, and complete mathematical explanations. You can literally SEE the linear pieces and watch how they combine to create complex functions! 📊
